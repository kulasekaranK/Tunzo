const apiHistory = [
  // 1. System Prompt: Should be sent once at the start.
  // NOTE: It is better to use the `systemInstruction` parameter if available, 
  // but if not, sending it as the first user message is a common workaround.
  { role: 'user', parts: [{ text: TUNZO_SYSTEM_PROMPT }] },
  
  // 2. Previous Turns: Map the history (old user/model messages)
  // The structure of history here is { role: 'user' | 'model', text: string }
  ...history.map(item => ({ role: item.role, parts: [{ text: item.text }] })),

  // 3. Current User Turn: The latest prompt
  { role: 'user', parts: [{ text: prompt }] },
];

const response = await this.ai.models.generateContent({
model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
contents: apiHistory, // Use the correctly structured array
});

      console.error('AI chat error:', error);
      return 'Sorry, something went wrong. Try again.';
